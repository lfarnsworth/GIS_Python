# 1. List values
# Using this list:
#
# [1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 20, 32, 46, 85]
# Make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
# Write this in one line of Python.

List_1 = [1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 20, 32, 46, 85]
result = [x for x in List_1 if x < 5]
print(result)
