## NRS528_Coding Challenges


**Coding Challenge 1**

*A little About Me*

* My name is Lauren Farnsworth, I'm in my second year of the Marine Affairs Masters Program. 
* I'm currently working on a thesis project that has a lot to do with Rhode Island boaters' toilet habits.
* _Seriously._
* I am looking at how RI boaters perceive the No Discharge Zone policy, which essentially makes it _**illegal**_ for them to dump their raw sewage into the Bay.
* I grew up in Bristol, RI and now live in New Haven, CT.
* My undergraduate degree is in Environmental Science from Northeastern Univesity, in Massachusetts.
* I _really_ **love** sushi and I hope I can get some tonight!
* I have a super cute dog. Her name is Olga, and she is afraid of everything.

Prior to starting school at URI I worked as a science educator with Save the Bay. We took students of all ages from all backgrounds onto our boats to learn about Narragansett Bay.

I'm super excited to learn about coding in Python with @marecotec .
