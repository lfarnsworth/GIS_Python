## NRS528_Coding Challenges


**Coding Challenge 1**

*A little About Me*

* My name is Lauren Farnsworth, I'm in my second year of the Marine Affairs Masters Program. 
* I'm currently working on thesis project that has a lot to do with Rhode Island boaters' toilet habits.
* _Seriously._
* I am looking at how RI boaters perceive the No Discharge Zone policy, which essentially makes it _**illegal**_ for them to dump their raw sewage into the Bay.
* I grew up in Bristol, RI and now live in New Haven, CT.
* My undergraduate degree is in Environmental Science from Northeastern Univesity, in Massachusetts.
* I _really_ **love** sushi and I hope I can get some tonight!
* I have a super cute dog. Her name is Olga, and she is afraid of everything.
