* My name is Lauren Farnsworth, I'm in my second year of the Marine Affairs :ocean: Masters Program. 
* I'm currently working on a thesis project that has a lot to do with Rhode Island boaters' :toilet: habits.
* _Seriously._
* I am looking at how RI boaters perceive the No Discharge Zone policy, which essentially makes it _**illegal**_ for them to dump their raw sewage :poop: into the Bay.
* I grew up in Bristol, RI and now live in New Haven, CT.
* My undergraduate degree is in Environmental Science from Northeastern Univesity, in Massachusetts.
* I _really_ **love** sushi and I hope I can get some tonight!
* I have a super cute dog :dog: . Her name is Olga, and she is afraid of everything.

Prior to starting school at URI I worked as a science educator with Save the Bay. We took students of all ages from all backgrounds onto our boats to learn about Narragansett Bay.
